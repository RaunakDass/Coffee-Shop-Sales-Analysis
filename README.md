# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

## Overview
This project involves analyzing the sales data of a coffee shop chain with multiple locations. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis (EDA) and the creation of an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize various sales metrics and trends.

## Features

### Data Analysis
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Conducted in Python on a dataset containing over 145,000 rows to uncover initial insights and prepare data for visualization.

### Power BI Dashboard
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard that includes the following features:
  - **Total Sales**: Displays the overall sales figures.
  - **Total Orders**: Shows the total number of orders placed.
  - **Total Quantity Sold**: Indicates the total number of items sold.
  - **Monthly Sales Analysis**: Analyzes sales trends on a monthly basis.
  - **Day-wise Sales Analysis**: Breaks down sales by day of the week.
  - **Hourly Sales Analysis**: Provides insights into sales performance at different times of the day.
  - **Top Selling Product Categories**: Highlights the most popular product categories.
  - **Top Selling Products**: Lists the best-selling products.
  - **Sales by Weekdays and Weekends**: Compares sales performance on weekdays versus weekends.
  - **Sales by Store Location**: Analyzes sales distribution across different store locations.
  - **Sales Trend Over the Period**: Shows the overall sales trend throughout the analyzed period.
- **DAX Operations**: Implemented various DAX operations to enhance the dashboard's analytical capabilities.
- **Tooltips**: Added tooltips for the calendar heatmap and hourly heatmap to provide additional context and details.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For performing exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- **Power BI**: For creating an interactive and visually appealing dashboard.
- **DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)**: For complex calculations and data manipulation in Power BI.
